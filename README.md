# Jon Thielen

*It looks like you've caught my website in the middle of the migration! Below is a text-only version in the interim.*

I’m an Iowa State graduate student in meteorology, open source Python developer, 
ham radio operator (call: WXØJT), and Catholic. I’m always curious and love learning
and helping others, especially within the realm of math, science, and technology. 
I’m particularly enthusiastic about Python in the atmospheric sciences and using 
data science to investigate severe weather phenomena. If you’re interested in finding 
out more or getting in touch with me, please feel free to use the links above. Thank You!
